# Frontend-Only Version

This repository has been converted to a **frontend-only** version. All database and authentication logic has been removed.

## What Was Removed

### Backend Components
- âœ… Prisma database setup and schema
- âœ… Better-auth authentication system
- âœ… All server actions (`src/actions/`)
- âœ… API routes for auth and Plaid
- âœ… Authentication middleware
- âœ… Trigger.dev background jobs

### Database Dependencies
- âœ… `@prisma/client`
- âœ… `@prisma/extension-accelerate`
- âœ… `prisma` (dev dependency)
- âœ… `better-auth`
- âœ… `plaid`
- âœ… `react-plaid-link`
- âœ… `openai`
- âœ… `resend`
- âœ… `@trigger.dev/sdk`

## What Remains

### Frontend Components
- âœ… All UI components (`shadcn/ui`, Radix UI)
- âœ… Marketing pages (landing page, blog, help, etc.)
- âœ… Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- âœ… Animations (Framer Motion)
- âœ… Icons and assets
- âœ… Content collections for blog posts
- âœ… Theme system (dark/light mode)

### Modified Components
- **`nav-user.tsx`** - Now uses mock user data instead of auth session
- **`waitlist-form.tsx`** - Simulates form submission without backend
- **`app-sidebar.tsx`** - Kept as-is for UI structure

## Running the Project

Since you already have `node_modules` installed with pnpm, you can continue using:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## What You Have Now

This is a **pure frontend demo** project with:
- Complete UI/UX components
- Marketing website
- Blog system
- Beautiful landing page
- Design system
- Component library

Perfect for:
- UI/UX showcasing
- Design system development
- Frontend prototyping
- Component library demonstrations
- Static site deployment

## Notes

- All authentication flows have been removed
- Dashboard pages that required database data have been removed
- Forms now use local state or mock submissions
- No environment variables are required except `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

## Structure

```

    â”œâ”€â”€ config.tsx      # Site configuration
    â””â”€â”€ utils.ts        # Utility functions
```

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Use this as a design system showcase
2. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify as a static site
3. Add new frontend features without backend concerns
4. Use it as a component library for other projects
5. Integrate with any backend of your choice later

Enjoy your clean, frontend-only codebase! ðŸŽ¨
