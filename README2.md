> **Ushering in a new era of financial management with cutting-edge AI**

Ballast redefines how you track, analyze, and optimize your finances, ensuring smarter, more secure financial decisions. Gain unparalleled insights into your spending habits and financial patterns, empowering you to budget better and experience more.

## üéØ Vision & Value Proposition

Ballast aims to be the "Copilot for Money" - an AI-powered financial management platform that provides:

- **Unified Financial Dashboard** - All accounts in one place via Plaid integration
- **AI-Driven Insights** - Smart spending analysis, trend detection, and personalized recommendations
- **Automated Budgeting** - Dynamic budget creation and optimization based on spending patterns
- **Real-time Financial Health** - Instant alerts, goal tracking, and financial score monitoring
- **Family-First Design** - Multi-user households with role-based permissions and shared budgets

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Dual-Layer Architecture

Our system implements a clean separation between authentication and business logic:

#### 1. **Authentication Layer**
- User identity and session management
- OAuth provider integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Better-auth powered authentication
- Independent of business domain

#### 2. **Application Layer**
- Financial domain models (accounts, transactions, budgets)
- Family/household organization
- AI insights and recommendations
- Where the actual application logic lives

### Why This Architecture?

- **Clean Separation** - Auth concerns vs business logic are completely separate
- **Auth Flexibility** - Can swap auth systems without touching financial data
- **Multi-Tenancy** - Families can have multiple users with different roles
- **Scalability** - Different optimization strategies for each layer
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries make code easier to understand and modify
