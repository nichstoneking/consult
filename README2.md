## 🎯 Vision & Value Proposition

Badget aims to be the "Copilot for Money" - an AI-powered financial management platform that provides:

- **Unified Financial Dashboard** - All accounts in one place via Plaid integration
- **AI-Driven Insights** - Smart spending analysis, trend detection, and personalized recommendations
- **Automated Budgeting** - Dynamic budget creation and optimization based on spending patterns
- **Real-time Financial Health** - Instant alerts, goal tracking, and financial score monitoring
- **Family-First Design** - Multi-user households with role-based permissions and shared budgets

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Dual-Layer Architecture

Our system implements a clean separation between authentication and business logic:

#### 1. **Authentication Layer**
- User identity and session management
- OAuth provider integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Better-auth powered authentication
- Independent of business domain

#### 2. **Application Layer**
- Financial domain models (accounts, transactions, budgets)
- Family/household organization
- AI insights and recommendations
- Where the actual application logic lives

### Why This Architecture?

- **Clean Separation** - Auth concerns vs business logic are completely separate
- **Auth Flexibility** - Can swap auth systems without touching financial data
- **Multi-Tenancy** - Families can have multiple users with different roles
- **Scalability** - Different optimization strategies for each layer
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries make code easier to understand and modify
