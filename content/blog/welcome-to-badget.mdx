# Welcome to Ballast - Building the Future of Link Management

Hey there! I'm Christer, the founder of Ballast. I wanted to take a moment to personally welcome you to our platform and share a bit about why we're building Ballast.

## The Problem We're Solving

As someone who's been in the tech industry for years, I've always been frustrated by the complexity of existing link management tools. They're either too simple and lack the features you need, or they're overly complex with pricing that makes your head spin.

I started Ballast because I believe link management should be:

- **Simple** - Easy to use without a steep learning curve
- **Powerful** - Rich analytics and insights when you need them  
- **Affordable** - Fair pricing that scales with your needs
- **Beautiful** - A tool you actually enjoy using

## What Makes Ballast Different

### AI-Powered Insights

We're not just another link shortener. Our AI analyzes your link performance and provides actionable insights to help you optimize your content strategy.

### Developer-First Approach

As a developer myself, I know how important it is to have robust APIs and integrations. Ballast is built API-first, so you can integrate it into any workflow.

### Focus on Privacy

Your data is yours. We don't sell your information or track users across the web. Simple as that.

## What's Next

We're just getting started! Over the coming months, you'll see us ship:

- Enhanced analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features  
- More integrations with your favorite tools
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android

## Join Us on This Journey

Building a product is a journey, and I'd love for you to be part of it. Whether you're a casual user or managing links for a large organization, your feedback helps shape Ballast.

Feel free to reach out to me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christerhagen) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/christerhagen). I read every message and love hearing from our users.

Thanks for being here, and welcome to Ballast!

â€” Christer
