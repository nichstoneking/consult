## Analytics Dashboard Overview

The analytics dashboard gives you a comprehensive view of your link performance. Access your [dashboard](/dashboard) to follow along with these examples:

### Real-time Metrics

- **Click Volume**: Track clicks in real-time
- **Geographic Distribution**: See where your traffic is coming from
- **Device Breakdown**: Understanding mobile vs desktop usage
- **Referrer Analysis**: Identify your top traffic sources

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Monitor your CTR to understand engagement levels:

```typescript
interface ClickThroughRate {
  totalClicks: number;
  totalImpressions: number;
  ctr: number; // clicks / impressions * 100
}

const calculateCTR = (clicks: number, impressions: number): number => {
  return impressions > 0 ? (clicks / impressions) * 100 : 0;
};
```

### Geographic Performance

Understanding geographic performance helps optimize targeting:

- **Top Countries**: Identify your primary markets
- **Regional Trends**: Spot emerging opportunities
- **Time Zone Analysis**: Optimize posting schedules

## Advanced Filtering

Use filters to drill down into specific data:

1. **Date Ranges**: Compare performance across different periods
2. **Traffic Sources**: Analyze performance by referrer
3. **Device Types**: Optimize for specific devices
4. **Custom UTM Parameters**: Track campaign performance
