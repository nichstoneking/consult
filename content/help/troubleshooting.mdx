2. **Create Rules**: Set up automatic rules for specific merchants
3. **Review Merchant Names**: Some transactions have unclear descriptions
4. **Split Transactions**: Divide mixed purchases across categories
5. **Update Categories**: Customize categories to match your spending

**Creating Categorization Rules**:

If description contains "ATM" → Assign to "Cash & ATM"
```

### Duplicate Transactions Appearing

**Problem**: Same transaction shows up multiple times.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Multiple Accounts**: Transaction might appear on different accounts
